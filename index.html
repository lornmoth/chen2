<h2>RIP 4/15/19 ~ 1/15/20</h2>
</div>
	<p><strong>chen2 has been shut down as of 1/15/2020</strong> after a 9 month run, due to absentee admins unavailable to moderate spam and fedpoasts. chen2 was intended only as a <a href="realtime_paper.html">proof-of-concept</a> for the efficacy of realtime imageboards in achieving a thriving community from even a small exit pool, and in this it was a <a href="launch.png">total success</a>, so much so that it was kept online just for the sake of the community that formed around it.</p>

	<p>The realtime feature provides much more momentum to board activity, allowing splinter communities to both exit and survive easily in a way that was not possible with static imageboards\; chen2 should be treated as inspiration for the <a href="realtime_paper.html">seeds of a new imageboard revival.</a></p> 
	
	<p>A guide for reproducing the imageboard is posted <a href="guide.html">here</a>. We were able to host our ~700-1200 daily unique IP traffic load for just $15/month on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/linux-distribution/debian/">Digital Ocean's 60GB HDD 3GB RAM instance</a>. chen2 was launched using existing <a href="https://github.com/bakape/meguca/">meguca</a> software without any prior technical knowledge, and we found even small communities of 5-10 able to thrive as independent boards. You have no excuse for not launching your own chan!</p>

<h2>Community Moderation</h2>
</div>
<p>Community culture is important to every imageboard, but it's damaged by moderator interference and non-assimilating outsiders. Here moderation is transparent by design, and aims only to act as an extension of the community will: stepping in whenever community shaming of an especially stubborn outsider has proven ineffective.</p> <p>If you're new here, try to lurk and learn the culture before posting!</p>
